Repo Deprecation Warning
========================

Adhearsion
==========

Adhearsion is an open-source voice application development framework. Adhearsion users write applications atop the framework with Ruby and **call into their code**.

Adhearsion rests above a lower-level telephony platform, namely [Asterisk](http://asterisk.org), though there are experimental bindings for both [FreeSWITCH](http://freeswitch.org) and [Yate](http://yate.null.ro/pmwiki).

Adhearsion has...

* An elegant dialplan system for writing the code which controls a live phone call
* A sophisticated Asterisk Manager Interface library with a lexer written in [Ragel](http://www.complang.org/ragel).
* An events subsystem which maintains a Thread-pool for executing your namespaced callbacks. (supports AMI events too!)
* A very useful component architecture with which you may write Adhearsion plugins and share them with the world.
* JRuby compatibility for running atop the Java Virtual Machine and using virtually any Java library.
* Good regression test coverage

Use the public Adhearsion sandbox!
==================================

Don't want to screw with setting up a telephony system? You can test your Adhearsion applications using our public sandbox!

Yes, in minutes you can be controlling your cell phone for free!  :)
