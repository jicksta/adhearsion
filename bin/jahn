You must use jahn with JRuby! Are you running this script after installing Adhearsion with non-JRuby RubyGems?

If you don't want to install Adhearsion with the JRuby version of RubyGems, try running jahn directly with an absolute path:

#{File.expand_path(__FILE__)} start your_app_name

Note: You must have the jruby executable in your $PATH and $JRUBY_HOME set.
